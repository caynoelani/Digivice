# Digivice

### About
***Digivice*** is a project created to practice fullstack CRUD applications in the `Python` stack.

The project is based on an apparatus from hit children's franchise *Digimon*, known as a *digivice*, where users can view all the creatures and stats of Digimon's digital world.

This project is written in `Python` using the `Flask framework`, `Jinja2`, and `Digimon Api`. Users can register and login, as well as save their favorite Digimon with the use of a `MySQL` database. All queries are done manually without the use of an ORM.

All styling is written in `CSS` using `BEM` naming conventions and a mobile-first, responsive design.
